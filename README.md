### Hello all, I'm Scott Cormier ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**scotcorm/scotcorm** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
-->

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on portfolio projects that track data, and support sharing images licensed CC0
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m a MLIS grad focusing on Data Curation, and a recent nucamp grad focusing mostly on learning React for now. 
- ðŸ‘¯ I'm a big fan of Institutional Repositories like tDAR and sites like The Noun Project that encourage sharing info with Creative Commons licenses. 
- âš¡ Fun fact: I built a website for my old Wing Chun group, and it helped introduce me to HTML, CSS and some JS (https://scotcorm.github.io/Chicago-Wing-Chun/)
