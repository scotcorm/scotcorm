### Hello all, I'm Scott Cormier ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**scotcorm/scotcorm** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a project that tracks data using ChartJS, and another project that supports sharing images licensed CC0
- ðŸŒ± I started coding while working on my MLIS, to support my Data Curation projects, and now I'm a recent nucamp grad focusing mostly on the frontend and learning more about React 
- ðŸ‘¯ I'm a big fan of Institutional Repositories like tDAR and sites like The Noun Project that encourage sharing info with Creative Commons licenses. 
- âš¡ Fun fact: I built a website for my old Wing Chun group, and it helped introduce me to HTML, CSS and some JS (https://scotcorm.github.io/Chicago-Wing-Chun/)
